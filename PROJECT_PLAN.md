## Dental Clinic Website Project Plan

### 1. Project Goal
To create a modern, professional, and user-friendly website for a dental clinic, focusing on attracting new patients and providing essential information about services and contact details.

### 2. Current Status

#### 2.1. Website Plan Outline
*   **Application Type:** Web Application (Frontend)
*   **Core Technologies:** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for the frontend, Bootstrap CSS with Material Design principles for UI/UX.
*   **Key Features & Sections:**
    *   **Homepage:** Hero section, clinic introduction, services overview, call to action, testimonials snippets.
    *   **Services Page:** Detailed descriptions of all services (General Dentistry, Cosmetic Dentistry, Orthodontics, Implants, Pediatric Dentistry, Emergency Care), benefits-oriented language, optional before & after gallery.
    *   **About Us Page:** Clinic story/philosophy, professional photos and biographies of the team, images of clinic facilities.
    *   **Contact Page:** Contact form, embedded map, address, phone, email, business hours, emergency contact.
    *   **Appointment Booking:** Online form for appointment requests, alternative booking methods.
    *   **Testimonials/Reviews Page:** In-depth patient reviews.
    *   **FAQ Section:** Answers to common questions.
*   **Visual Design & UX Principles:** Clean & Modern Aesthetic, Professional Photography, Intuitive Navigation, Responsive Design, Trust & Credibility, Accessibility (ADA Compliance).

#### 2.2. Image Preparation
*   10 core images (hero banner, clinic exterior/interior, staff, service-specific) have been successfully downloaded and renamed in the `C:\Users\user\Downloads` folder to their final descriptive names (e.g., `hero_banner.jpg`, `clinic_exterior.jpg`, etc.).
*   The clinic logo (`logo.png`) is also present and correctly named in the `Downloads` folder.

#### 2.3. Icon Strategy
*   Individual SVG files for icons (like phone, email, location) will *not* be used. Instead, an icon library (e.g., Bootstrap Icons, Material Icons, or Font Awesome) will be integrated directly into the website for efficient and scalable icon management.

#### 2.4. Testimonials
*   Instead of using a testimonial image, testimonial text will be generated and integrated into the website.

### 3. Next Steps (What I will do)

1.  **Move Images:** Transfer all prepared images from `C:\Users\user\Downloads` to the project's designated image directory: `C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Imágenes\DEMOS\demo clinica\docs\images`.
2.  **Scaffold Project:** Initialize a new React project within `C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Imágenes\DEMOS\demo clinica`.
3.  **Implement Website Sections:** Develop the HTML structure and apply styling for each planned section (Homepage, Services, About Us, Contact, etc.).
4.  **Integrate Icon Library:** Add and configure the chosen icon library to display necessary icons.
5.  **Generate Testimonials:** Create placeholder testimonial text for the website.
6.  **Build & Verify:** Build the application and perform basic verification to ensure it runs without errors and meets the outlined features.
